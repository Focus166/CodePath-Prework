## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The main challenge I faced while building this app was that I had no prior experience with Swift. Since it was my first time working with the language, I had to spend extra time learning the basics and understanding how Swift differs from languages Iâ€™m more familiar with, such as C++. Fortunately, some of the syntax felt similar to C++, which made the learning process smoother.

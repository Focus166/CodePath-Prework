## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The main challenge I faced while building this app was that I had no prior experience with Swift. Fortunately, some of the syntax felt similar to C++, which made the learning process smoother.Â 


##App Brainstorming

 1) Tiktok
 -Ability to post videos
 -Like or dislike videos
 -repost videos
 2)Instagram
 -Post stories
 -Add highlights/posts
 -Change profile picture
 3)Snapchat
 -Text other people
 -Have streaks with each other
 -Save pictures for memories 
 4) Apple Music
 -Listen to music, suffle
 -Create playlist with all your favorite music
 -Have a certain playlist generated for you
 
 I want to build a music app that combines elements of TikTok/Instagram. You'll be able to publish your playlist for others to listen to. I want to implement a like and dislike feature. You'll have a public profile with all the playlists you've created. You'll be able to change how your profile looks, for example, your profile picture or the background color.Â
